# Development Practices

**Last Modified: 2022-01-28**

## Introduction

This document provides some general development practices that I am to follow throughout my projects, that I have 
applied to this website in particular.

## Standard Principles
1. **Keep a change log**
   - Maintain a log of all feature changes and bug fixes.
   - This allows for visibility of the project as it evolves, as well as ensures accountability for releasing 
     reliable and well-documented features.
   - See [`changelog.md`](changelog.md) for this project's change log.
2. **Document, then build, then document**
   - Documentation is crucial for understanding future changes, past implementations, and working in ambiguous 
     problem spaces; make sure solutions are well-documented to address a problem, and findings are captured in the 
     development process.
   - Leverage this repository's [architecture](../architecture) docs, when possible.
3. **Incremental and experimental development**
   - A good project should release incremental changes, but not veer away from innovation.
   - Release frequent and concise functionalities, but build on experimental solutions.
   - Use experimental or feature development branches to experiment with new features.
