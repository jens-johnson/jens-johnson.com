**CURRENT STATUS [2022-01-28]**

The website is currently still in pre-release (0.5.0) as I work to get some last functional pieces going. If all
goes well (🤞🏻), I hope to release v1 very soon. Stay tuned...

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code used to run my personal website, as well as documentation surrounding the 
creation of the project, technical solutions, and miscellaneous findings. A great place to learn more about this 
application, how I built it, and how it works, is by reading the
[Creation Overview Guide](docs/creation_documentation/overview.md) I've created in the docs directory. Thanks for 
visiting, and I'm always open to feedback, questions, concerns, etc.
